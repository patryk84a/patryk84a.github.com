            <h2>Interest in App Inventor</h2>
            <p>I am interested in developing App Inventor because I believe in its educational potential. I would like to improve components and add new features so that novice programmers, including children and youth, can create advanced applications without using extensions. I have learned programming thanks to App Inventor.</p>

            <h2>Proposed summer project</h2>
            <p>I would like to continue working on the ListView component, which fascinates me with its possibilities. My recent PR with a new layout is just the beginning. I propose creating an "Element Layout Editor" that would allow for the creation of custom layouts beyond the five predefined ones. The editor would enable the use of images, main and detailed text, vertical and horizontal arrangements, and alignment settings. Additionally, I would like to add a grid layout, which, combined with the image (top) layout, would create a gallery effect. Another feature would be "Page Snapping," ideal for creating photo viewers. I would also like to contribute to the development of ListView for iOS. I want this component to be as versatile, efficient and intuitive as possible.</p>

            <h2>Interest in introductory programming</h2>
            <p>I have no formal teaching experience, but programming is my hobby, which I developed thanks to App Inventor. As a PowerUser in the App Inventor community, I help novice users solve problems, which indirectly contributes to their learning. I am happy to share my knowledge and help others.</p>

            <h2>Experience with development tools</h2>
            <p>My experience with development tools is mainly related to the App Inventor repository. I contributed to the refactoring of the ListView and Slider components and created the <code>@UsesXml</code> annotation. I have also created several extensions for App Inventor.</p>

            <h2>Experience with teams, online developer communities, and large code bases</h2>
            <p>My experience with large codebases is based on working with the App Inventor repository. I participated in the refactoring of components, which required understanding the code structure and collaborating with other developers. Additionally, as a PowerUser in the App Inventor community, I actively help other users, which requires cooperation and communication.</p>
